            Essentially, camera could be defined as a machinery which is able to capture and record lights and process visual information into a permanent photograph. From the first prototype invented by French inventor Nicephore Niepce in 1816, cameras have evolved over hundreds of years and become a part of daily life nowadays. On the contrary, with the development of modern technology, the function of traditional cameras is gradually substituted by phones. Will cameras disappear in the future? If something substitute cameras in the future, is that object could be called as a camera? What is the way of existence of camera in the future? In the future, will cameras exist in physical forms like they used to or become a metaphysical concept attached to another entity?
